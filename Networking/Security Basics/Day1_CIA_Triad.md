# Day 1 – CIA Triad 🔐

## 📌 What is CIA Triad?

The CIA Triad is the foundation of Cyber Security.  
It focuses on protecting data and systems using three main principles:

1. Confidentiality  
2. Integrity  
3. Availability  

---

## 🔑 Confidentiality
Confidentiality means protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

### Example:
- Banking passwords  
- Personal data  
- OTP  

### How to ensure:
- Encryption (AES, RSA)
- VPN
- Access control
- Multi-factor authentication

---

## 🔑 Integrity
Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unchanged.

### Example:
If someone changes your bank balance, integrity is broken.

### How integrity is ensured:
- Hashing (MD5, SHA)
- Digital signatures
- Data validation

### Hashing concept:
Even a small change in data produces a completely different hash value.

---

## 🔑 Availability
Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible whenever needed.

### Example:
Banking apps, hospital systems.

### How to ensure:
- Backups
- Failover
- DDoS protection

---

## 💡 Key Learning
Understanding these fundamentals is very important before moving into advanced topics like ethical hacking and SOC.

## 🎯 Next Goal
Networking basics and OSI model.
